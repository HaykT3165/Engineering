        <br> Hello There!
        <br> I will post my work here
        <br> 
        <br> <h2>Engineering Journal</h2>
        <p>9/2/2022, This week we were introduced to mechanical engineering and learned how everything works. 
        We also learned about a website called tinkercad which is a website where you create 3d models to test how things 
        work if you were to build it. today we had a tinkercad challenge which was who could make the best home appliance. 
        I made a fridge and got pretty close to winning</p>
        <br><p>9/16/22, This week we had a few substitutes because mr. Kim was sick.
        We also worked on tinkrcad to make a Ruth Goldberg machine, we started cutting our cardboard
        on tuesday. Today we had a challenge where we made paper boats and put weights on them
        to see whos boat stayed afloat the longest.</p>
        <br><p>9/23/22, This week we worked on our Ruth Goldberg machines and
        we started testing on wednsday. We finished ours on friday and started testing.
        our group tested and we did pretty good.</p>
        <br><p>9/30/22 This week learned about mechanical engineering. we were given
        laptops and we had to take them appart and put them together.
         when my group put it together we had some screws left over</p>
