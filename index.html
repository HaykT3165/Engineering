        <br> Hello There!
        <br> I will post my work here
        <br> 
        <br> <h2>Engineering Journal</h2>
        <p>9/2/2022, This week we were introduced to mechanical engineering and learned how everything works. 
        We also learned about a website called tinkercad which is a website where you create 3d models to test how things 
        work if you were to build it. today we had a tinkercad challenge which was who could make the best home appliance. 
        I made a fridge and got pretty close to winning</p>
        <br><p>9/16/22, This week we had a few substitutes because mr. Kim was sick.
        We also worked on tinkrcad to make a Ruth Goldberg machine, we started cutting our cardboard
        on tuesday. Today we had a challenge where we made paper boats and put weights on them
        to see whos boat stayed afloat the longest.</p>
        <br><p>9/23/22, This week we worked on our Ruth Goldberg machines and
        we started testing on wednsday. We finished ours on friday and started testing.
        our group tested and we did pretty good.</p>
        <br><p>9/30/22 This week learned about mechanical engineering. we were given
        laptops and we had to take them appart and put them together.
         when my group put it together we had some screws left over</p>
         <br><p>10/7/22 we learned about bioengineering and about prosthetics and we made
          prosthetics for animas with tinkercad</p>
         <br><p>10/14/22 this week we learned about aerospace engineering. we started
         a new project  which was making a bottle rocket.</p>
         <br><p>10/21/22 this week we started making our cads of rockets, built it and tested them
         our rocket didnt work becuse it had a hole in it. The water kept leaking out of the rocket. Because of that error we couldnt launch so we too the tocket off the launch pad.</p>
        <br><p>10/28/22 this week we learned about bioengineering an did a water filtration
        lab where we put layers of rocks and some cotton and try to filter out bad water and
         make the water clear. our group did a pretty good job at it and made the dirty water
         very clear leaving the dirt in the rocks and cotton.</p>
         <br><p>11/4/22 This week we started electrical engineering and we started working
         on trying to make LEDs light up with batteries and resistors. I understood how to do it pretty
          well so i got it done fast, it was pretty easy.</p>
         <br><p>JANUARY, this month was our first month back from school, we learned about new types of engineering such as chemical and nuclear energy. we also learned
          about arduino cars and mouse trap cars. My group chose the mouse trap car</p>
